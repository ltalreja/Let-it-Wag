# Let-it-Wag

Let It Wag was a passionate project built in JAVA Swing framework with DB4 object database. The project was built using Singleton and Factory Design Patterns of Java. The core concept of the project was the ability to report a stray pets across geographical areas and being able to monitor their status after they are taken into shelter homes. To make it a feature rich application, we implemented Splash Screen, JBrowser to point location on Google Maps, JFreeCharts for showcasing different types of analysis, Email using SMTP, Log4J for logging each transactions. Apart from this, the system had over 18 roles spanning across 2 networks involving 8 major work flows and was capable to handle multiple employees spanning across the ecosystem, from the user who reports the pet; to the pet shelter office administration and field workers. It also had the ability for the pet shelter to access supply chain and medical facilities on a work-request basis thereby maintaining request queues.
